/**
 *
 *
 *
 * You are given an array A of distinct integers, you have to return another array B which transforms the first array such
 * that the minimum element in the new array is 1 and all the other elements maintain their relative ordering
 * i.e. if A[i] > A[j] then it should also be that B[i] > B[j] and similarly for other elements.
 * Also, the maximum number in B should be minimized. Better explanation of this question can be found here.
 *
 * Input: [4, 2, 3, 7]
 * Output: [3, 1, 2, 4]
 *
 * Input: [-4, -2, -3, -7]
 * Output: [2, 4, 3, 1]
 * Follow ups:
 *
 * What if the elements are not distinct?
 * Second question: You have to perform the same operation on a 2D array of distinct elements.
 * What if the matrix has duplicates?
 * Input:
 * 1 5 6
 * 4 3 2
 * 8 7 9
 *
 * Output:
 * 1 3 4
 * 3 2 1
 * 5 4 6
