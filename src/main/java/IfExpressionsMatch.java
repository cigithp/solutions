/**
 * Given two expression in the form of a binary tree, find if both the expressions are equivalent.

 *   a a b c
 * You are given root of the two trees. There are only lowercase english alphabets and only addition operator.
 *
 * **Follow up - **
 *
 * Subtract operator is also there. How will you evaluate that.
 *
 * exp1 = (a + b) + (c - a)
 * exp2 = (a + b) - (c - a)
 * Follow up -
 *
 * Multiplication operator is also there.
 *
 * exp1 = (a + b)*(c + d)
 * exp2 = ac + db + cb + bd
